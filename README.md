    "benefitDetails":"Wisdom teeth don’t always have to cause pain to set the stage for future dental problems. The movement of surrounding teeth caused by emerging wisdom teeth is often slow and may not induce any pain. However, if you or a family member has had braces or some other orthodontic treatment, crowding from wisdom teeth can potentially undo that work.
    When you visit our office, depending on your individual needs, we may recommend removing some or all of your wisdom teeth to help alleviate any current pain. Additionally, we may also recommend removing problem wisdom teeth sooner rather than later to avoid future complications that could result in a dental emergency. Allow our skilled team to determine the position of your wisdom teeth and the type of extraction that best serves your needs. Schedule an appointment with our dental office today and be step closer to ending your wisdom tooth pain.
